    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am first generation in my family. I have three younger siblings Ethan, Mia, and Chris. I gradtauted High School in 2019 and right after I went to cosmetology school. I got my Masters Cosmetology license
        and started doing hair going to peoples houses or having them come to mine. I eventually worked in a salon for about three years. My favorite thing to do in the salon was color services.
        I also enjoyed doing makeup for clients when they had events to go to.   </p>
